# Class 12 Recap

Hello Students,

As you know we dedicated our last class to taking a Final Exam, which I have since [posted](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/exams/final/NYU-INFO-2335-70-Final-Exam.pdf) to the course repository. I aim to finish grading your final exams today, or at least within the next few days. When I am done I will post the answers along with a detailed grading rubric and a description of my grading process.

After I grade your final exams I will turn my focus to grading your freestyle projects (most likely not starting until tomorrow). If you need to make a few small tweaks to your freestyle project or otherwise continue working on it, feel free to do so today.

I believe starting today you also have access to the NYU Course Faculty Evaluation, so please check your email for a link and fill that out at your earliest convenience!

Look out for a final farewell announcement from me within the coming days.

\- Professor Rossetti
