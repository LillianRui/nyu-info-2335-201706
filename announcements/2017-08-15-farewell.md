# Farewell

Hello Students,

I have spent the past week grading your Final Exams and "Freestyle" Projects. The average and median exam grades were both 86%. And the average and median freestyle grades were 89% and 93%, respectively. Great job!

These grades are now reflected in the NYU Classes Gradebook, and a detailed Final Exam [Score Report](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/exams/final/results-public.csv) and [Rubric](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/blob/master/exams/final/rubric.csv) have been posted to GitHub. Also for your awareness, I have posted final grades with the registrar. Please reach out within the next few days if you have any questions about grades.

It has been a pleasure working with you this semester. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikerossetti/), and email me anytime at prof.mj.rossetti@gmail.com. Enjoy the rest of the summer, and good luck in your future endeavors!
